# SupplyFlares
*An unreleased Spigot/Bukkit plugin looking for love*

## About:
- This is a plugin I wrote to release as a premium (paid) plugin on Spigot.org that I never got around to releasing.
- Some of the code is clunky and inefficient at points, but in other places it is solid.
- If someone wants to continue / improve or release this plugin, I am open to discussion about doing so.
