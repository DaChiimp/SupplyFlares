# SupplyFlares
*An unreleased Spigot/Bukkit plugin looking for love*

**Note: This plugin needs optimization for a lot of the methods. Some of this was coded before I had a better knowledge. For example, there are a lot of else if statements that could be change to switch statements. Some places I duplicate code and could just reuse with custom functions etc.**

**_If you plan on using this, i'd optimize it for better performance and cleaner code._**

## About:
- This is a plugin I wrote to release as a premium (paid) plugin on Spigot.org that I never got around to releasing.
- Some of the code is clunky and inefficient at points, but in other places it is solid.
- If someone wants to continue / improve or release this plugin, I am open to discussion about doing so.
